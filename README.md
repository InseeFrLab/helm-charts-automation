# Helm charts Datascience

This collection of Helm Charts is tailored for datascientists !
It is primarly designed to work with [Onyxia](https://github.com/inseefrlab/onyxia) but also works as a standalone Helm repository.  
You should use official helm repository of each opensource software if you don't use onyxia.

To use the repo on helm (version 3+) :
```
helm repo add inseefrlab-datascience https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-automation
```  

The repo is also browsable directly https://inseefrlab.github.io/helm-charts-automation/index.yaml

Contributions are welcome, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests :)
